# Smart Thikana — Bangladesh House Rental Platform

A trust-first house-rental web app tailored for Bangladesh. Tenants discover
verified properties using the official **Division → District → Thana** address
hierarchy; landlords register properties against City Corporation tax keys
(holding number, ward, zone); both sides build reputation through peer
feedback and an automatically-generated rental history.

## 3. Database schema

| Table | Purpose | RLS summary |
|-------|---------|-------------|

| `profiles` | Per-user profile (name, phone, avatar, bio) | Read by all auth users; write own only |
| `user_roles` | `tenant` / `landlord` (separate table — never on profile, prevents privilege escalation) | Insert/read own only |
| `listings` | Properties with full BD schema (16 address fields + lat/lng) | Public read of `is_active`; write own (landlord-role) |
| `divisions` / `districts` / `thanas` | BD admin-hierarchy lookup tables (8 / 64 / ~570 rows) | Public read |
| `favorites` | Tenant-saved listings | Own rows only |
| `conversations` | One per (listing, tenant, landlord) | Participants only |
| `messages` | Chat messages (realtime) | Participants only |
| `agreements` | Deal status: `pending` / `accepted` / `rejected` | Participants read; tenant insert; landlord update |
| `payments` | Simulated payments with unique receipt # | Participants only |
| `kyc` | NID numbers + Storage URLs | Own rows only |
| `feedback` | Peer reviews | Author reads own; **same-role peers** read others |

### Key SQL helpers

- `has_role(uid, role)` — `SECURITY DEFINER` predicate used by all role-aware RLS policies (avoids recursive RLS).
- `get_tenant_rental_history(tenant_id)` — RPC returning a tenant's completed payments. Callable by the tenant themselves OR by any landlord (for trust verification).
- Storage bucket **`kyc-docs`** (private) — folder-scoped RLS so each user only accesses their own folder.

## 5. Notifications model

- `useMessageNotificationsRoot()` is mounted **exactly once** inside `<Navbar />`
  and owns the realtime subscription on `public.messages`.
- All other components (Navbar badge, Messages page) call the read-only
  `useMessageNotifications()` hook to read the unread counter.
- Toasts use Sonner; browser notifications use the standard Notification API
  (permission requested on first auth).
- Background push (closed-tab) requires a service worker + FCM/APNs and is
  out of scope for the MVP.

## 6. Local development

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

the generated TypeScript types are all managed for you. **Never hand-edit:**

- `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- `.env`

---

## 7. Deployment

1. Export to GitHub and host on Vercel / Netlify with the same env vars.
3. Database, auth, and storage are managed by Supabase.

---

## 8. Notes & limitations

- Payments are **simulated** — no real money moves. The receipt is for UX demo.
- Listing images are entered as URLs (Unsplash / your CDN). A storage bucket
  for direct image upload can be added later.
- `RentalHistory` for landlords is intentionally broad: any landlord with a
  valid User ID can pull any tenant's history. Tighten the RPC later if you
  want to restrict to landlords who actually transacted with that tenant.
- Theme uses the `mygov.bd` colour palette — Bangladesh green (`#006A4E`)
  primary + vermillion red (`#F42A41`) accent + green/red gov stripe.
